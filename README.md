# GameOfLife
Academic project based on [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) using Python and Ezgraphics library

<h2>RULES</h2>
- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation. <br>
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation. <br>
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation. <br>
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction. <br>

<h2>RUNNING</h2>
- You can click on any cell and change her value from dead to live. <br>
- STEP = button that simulates the evolution of the cells based on rules. <br>
- CLEAR = button that refreshes the grid. <br>
- GLIDER = button that creates an existing pattern. <br>
- QUIT = button that closes the program.
